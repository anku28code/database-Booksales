Book Sales Database
This project is a database of book sales. Using SQL, I have created and managed a database that records:

Types of books sold

Details of customers

Number of orders placed

This project demonstrates my understanding of SQL queries, table relationships, and basic data management.
 
The project includes SQL queries for creating tables, inserting records, and retrieving sales insights using JOIN, GROUP BY, and other commands.
